"An icon is a pictogram that is a symbol for some Topic" is documentation of it
"Icons/Pictogramms were first used in the 1972 olympics see http://www.piktogramm.de/pictoserver/pictosite/index/general_pic_4701/de/de_general_pic_univer_1.php
In computing, an icon is a pictogram displayed on a computer screen in order to help the user navigate a computer system or mobile device. The icon itself is a quickly comprehensible symbol of a software tool, function, or a data file, accessible on the system and is more like a traffic sign than a detailed illustration of the actual entity it represents.[1] It can serve as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data. The user can activate an icon using a mouse, pointer, finger, or recently voice commands. Their placement on the screen, also in relation to other icons, may provide further information to the user about their usage.[2] In activating an icon, the user can move directly into and out of the identified function without knowing anything further about the location or requirements of the file or code." is wikiDocumentation of it
